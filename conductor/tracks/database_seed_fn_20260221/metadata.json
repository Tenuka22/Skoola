  "description": "I need a full database Seed fn to be implemented and replace my old one, Also the see can only be called from the cargo run --bin seed and not using the http endpoint, So I need real life details and real names and real data. Also there should be thousands of items cus It;s need to be a real school, I need users to be generated with roles separately with the password from the config. The logic is in the seed but could improve, A full seed means all the roles and users must be correctly seeded according to real life, If needed create vec[] of real things that you can randomly pass. @backend/src/schema.rs should help you but using diels first generate the schema."
